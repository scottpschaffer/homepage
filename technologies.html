        <div>
            <p><img src="./angularjs.png" alt="Angular" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            I used Angular in my Front-end Capstone Project (Gift Card X-change). Can't wait to learn Angular 2.

            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p><img src="./bootstrap.png" alt="Bootstrap" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            I use Bootstrap regularly. I used it most recently in my Back-end Capstone (Wordris).

            <h3>C#</h3>
            <p><img src="./csharp.png" alt="csharp" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            The programming language I have used the most.  I taught myself C# when I was working at NAPCO (see my
            LinkedIn page) for creating many Apps that helped me in my testing.  It was nice when I could come back
            to it in the NSS Back-end course.

            Along with HTML, CSS3 was the main focus of the first 6 months (front-end development) of NSS.

            <h3>Git/GitHub</h3>
            <p><img src="./github.png" alt="Git" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            Git and GitHub was the backbone of our training.  We used this constantly throughout the year.

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p><img src="./java.png" alt="Java" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            Before NSS, I enrolled in the University of Illinois/O'Reilly School of Technology and obtained
            a Certificate of Professional Development in Java Programming.

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p><img src="./javascript.png" alt="JavaScript" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            Javascript was taught to us in the first 6 months (front-end development) of NSS.  My Back-end
            Capstone Project, Wordris, is written mostly in this language.
            </p>

            <h3>JQuery</h3>
            <p><img src="./jquery.png" alt="JQuery" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            JQuery is a JavaScript library that I use occasionally. For example, I used JQuery in Wordris
            for its AJAX calls.  
            </p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p><img src="./python.jpeg" alt="Python" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            I had to teach myself Python when I was working at Quanta. I was responsible for maintaining
            the test environments that our customers had set up, and their test scripts were written in
            Python 2.7 (not 3.0, unfortunately). I would have to make alterations in the scripts depending
            on changes in the hardware being repaired at the time.
            </p>

        <div>

            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <p><img src="./sql.jpeg" alt="SQL" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            I've used SQL quite a bit over the years. At NAPCO, our software product used a SQL Server DB,
            so when testing, I would have to create SQL Queries in SQL Server Management Studio to validate
            data. While at Quanta, I wrote code in Visual Basic that would collect test results and upload
            them to a central DB, for future reference. At the Tennessee Dept. of Education, I have had
            to write many SQL Queries (Selects with Joins) for data validation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <br>
            <h3>Visual Basic</h3>
            <p><img src="./VisualBasic.jpeg" alt="VB" height="50px" width="50px" class="lefty">
            I used Visual Basic while at Quanta to collect diagnostic test logs from the tablet
            computers and upload them to the central DB. Quanta used the test data to keep track every
            tablet sent in for repair.
