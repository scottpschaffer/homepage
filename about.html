        <p>I'm originally from Long Island, New York. I've been married to my wife,
            Carolyn, for over 16 years. We have two Golden Retrievers, Daisy and Rosie.</p>

        <p>I started out with computers early in life (Commodore 64, anyone?) and was always
        coding. I was a member of computer clubs in Junior High and High School,
        so it was not so surprising that I ended up getting a Bachelor of Science degree
        in Computer Science from State University of New York, College at Oswego.</p>

        <p>The first job I got was working in Software Quality Assurance. I enjoyed it quite a bit and
           stayed in the field for some time. Even as a Software QA Engineer, I was writing code,
           creating Apps and Utilities to enhance testing of software.</p>

        <p>It was after some consideration that I decided to make the official jump from
            testing to developing, and now that I've graduated from NSS, I'm excited to
            be starting the next phase of my professional life.</p>
