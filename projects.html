        <h3>Front-end Capstone: GiftCard X-Change</h3>
        <p>This project is a webpage where buyers and sellers of gift cards can go to
            rid themselves of unwanted cards. Written in Angular with a Firebase DB, this single-page app
            is designed for a buyer or seller to quickly create an account and then buy or sell their
            gift cards.

        <h3>Back-end Capstone: Wordris</h3>
        <p>This project is a Tetris-like game where the player directs falling blocks that each 
            contain a random letter into forming words. The words are validated by a Dictionary
            API and stored in an Entity Framework DB for later reference. Once validated, the
            word disappears and points are awarded, depending on the letters the word contains.
            If the letters accumulate too high, the game will end. This program is mostly written
            in Javascript with WebAPI and some C#.

        <h3>Side Projects: Project Euler puzzles</h3>
        <p>Project Euler is a website (ProjectEuler.net) that has mathematical problems that can be
           solved through the use of a computer. I have added some of my solutions to my GitHub page.
           They are just HTML files with Javascript embedded. The later ones (8-17) are commented. I
           am still updating the earlier ones (2-7) with comments.
