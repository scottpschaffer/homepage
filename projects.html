        <h2>Back-end Capstone: Wordris</h2>
        <p>This project is a Tetris-like game where the player directs falling blocks that each 
            contain a random letter into forming words. The words are validated by a Dictionary
            API and stored in an Entity Framework DB for later reference. Once validated, the
            word disappears and points are awarded, depending on the letters the word contains.
            If the letters accumulate too high, the game will end.
